#Payments
    First last month payments: This we need to change so that it is default to the end of the month

    Easy way to capture payments from a mobile view maybe (Dont think so beacuse they have a sheet)
    But maybe a  "My tasks" which is all the payments I should capture. 

#Room Rates
    Ability to maybe calulate a rooms rate per day
